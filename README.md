Arduino SDK
---

### Hardware

This SDK is for standard Arduino boards, such as
- Arduino Leonardo
- Arduino Ethernet

Other Arduino compatible boards, such as _Linkit One_ may work as well.

### Installation

Download the source code and unzip and copy the content to your arduino libraries folder (usually found at `/libraries`) _or_ import the .zip file directly using the Arduino IDE under Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP library

### Examples

Two basic examples are found in the `/libraries/ATT_IOT/examples` folder.
* `counter.ino` send data from your Arduino to AllThingsTalk _(sensing)_
* `led-actuation.ino` toggle a led on your Arduino from AllThingsTalk _(actuation)_
